              "question": "A drone is flying horizontally at a constant speed of 18 m/s at an altitude of 50 m above level ground. At a particular instant, it launches a small payload from its mechanism at a speed of 12 m/s relative to the drone, aiming the launcher at 40\u00b0 below the horizontal. Neglect air resistance. After release, the payload follows a projectile path and strikes the ground. What is the horizontal distance from the point on the ground directly beneath the launch point to the point where the payload lands?",
              "solution": "**Solution Explanation**\n\nThis question tests two key concepts: (1) vector addition of velocities when switching from the drone\u2019s frame to the ground frame, and (2) independent treatment of horizontal and vertical motion in 2D kinematics with a common time of flight.\n\n1. **Understand the question.** We must find how far horizontally the payload travels from its release point on the ground.  \n2. **Determine initial velocity components in the ground frame.**  \n   \u2022 The drone\u2019s horizontal speed is 18 m/s east.  \n   \u2022 The payload is launched at 12 m/s at 40\u00b0 below the horizontal relative to the drone.  \n\n   \u2013 Horizontal component of the launch relative to the drone:  \n     $$v_{x,\\text{rel}} = 12\\cos40^\\circ \\approx 12(0.7660)=9.192\\ \\text{m/s}$$  \n   \u2013 Vertical component (downward) relative to the drone:  \n     $$v_{y,\\text{rel}} = -12\\sin40^\\circ \\approx -12(0.6428)= -7.7136\\ \\text{m/s}$$  \n\n   \u2022 Converting to ground frame by adding the drone\u2019s velocity:  \n     $$v_{x0}=18 + 9.192=27.192\\ \\text{m/s}\\quad(\\text{east})$$  \n     $$v_{y0}=-7.7136\\ \\text{m/s}\\quad(\\text{downward})$$  \n\n3. **Find time of flight.**  \n   Vertical motion equation (taking upward positive, ground at y=0, release height y\u2080=50 m):  \n   $$y(t)=y_0+v_{y0}t-\\tfrac12gt^2=0$$  \n   Substitute:  \n   $$50 +(-7.7136)t -4.9t^2=0 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad 4.9t^2+7.7136t-50=0$$  \n   Solve for positive root:  \n   $$t=\\frac{-7.7136+\\sqrt{7.7136^2+4(4.9)(50)}}{2(4.9)}\\approx\\frac{-7.7136+32.25}{9.8}=2.5037\\ \\text{s}$$  \n\n4. **Compute horizontal range.**  \n   $$x= v_{x0}\\,t=27.192\\times2.5037\\approx68.1\\ \\text{m}$$  \n\n5. **Select the closest answer.**  The result \u224868 m corresponds to choice C.\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**  \nA. 47 m arises if one neglects the drone\u2019s motion or uses only the launch\u2019s horizontal component.  \nB. 63 m would follow from using an incorrect value for cos 40\u00b0 or an incorrect time of flight.  \nD. 75 m is too large\u2014it might result from assuming the payload is launched horizontally or from overestimating the vertical drop time.  \n\nBy carefully adding velocities and treating horizontal and vertical motions independently, choice C is confirmed.",

              "question": "A competitor at a physics-based archery challenge uses a calibrated launcher to fire foam arrows at a circular bull\u2019s-eye painted on a vertical wall that is level with the launch point. The target is a horizontal distance $D = 20.0\\,\\text{m}$ from the launcher, and the launcher is set to give each arrow the same initial speed $v_0 = 20.0\\,\\text{m/s}$. Neglecting air resistance, the competitor observes that there are two possible launch angles $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ (with $\\theta_1 < \\theta_2$) that result in a hit on the bull\u2019s-eye. To minimize the effects of gusts of wind on the time the arrow spends in flight, the competitor wants to compare the shorter time\u2010of\u2010flight $t_1$ (at angle $\\theta_1$) to the longer time\u2010of\u2010flight $t_2$ (at angle $\\theta_2$). What is the numerical value of the ratio $t_1/t_2$ for these two trajectories?",
              "solution": "This question tests your understanding of two-dimensional projectile motion by linking the horizontal range equation and the time\u2010of\u2010flight formula. It asks, in simpler terms: \u201cGiven the same launch speed and horizontal distance, two launch angles hit the same target\u2014what is the ratio of the shorter flight time to the longer flight time?\u201d\n\nStep 1: Use the range formula to find the two angles. The horizontal range for a projectile launched and landing at the same height is\n$$R = \\frac{v_0^2\\sin(2\\theta)}{g}\\,,$$\nwhere $R=D=20.0\\,\\text{m}$ and $v_0=20.0\\,\\text{m/s}$.

She throws a snowball from the base so that its initial speed is 20 m/s at 60\u00b0 above the horizontal. The snowball follows a parabolic trajectory and eventually strikes the slope further uphill. Neglect air resistance and assume the snowball remains airborne until it contacts the incline. How does the distance along the slope from the launch point change if her initial speed is reduced by a factor of two? Express the new landing distance as a fraction or multiple of the original distance.",
              "solution": "Knowledge Tested: This question tests 2D kinematics with projectile motion on an inclined plane and the dependence of range on launch speed.\n\nStep 1: Understand the question. A snowball is launched from the base of an incline (angle \u03c6=30\u00b0) with speed v. It lands at some distance s up the slope. We then reduce v by a factor of two and ask how s changes.\n\nStep 2: Set up coordinate relations. Use horizontal (x) and vertical (y) axes. The incline\u2019s surface has equation y_s(x)=x\u00b7tan30\u00b0.\n\nStep 3: Break the launch velocity into components:\n  \u2022 Horizontal component: v_x = v\u00b7cos60\u00b0\n  \u2022 Vertical component: v_y = v\u00b7sin60\u00b0\n\nStep 4: Write projectile\u2019s trajectory equations:\n  y_b(t)=v_y\u00b7t\u2212\u00bdg\u00b7t\u00b2\n  x_b(t)=v_x\u00b7t\n\nStep 5: Find contact time t_c by requiring y_b(t_c)=y_s(x_b(t_c)):\n  v\u00b7sin60\u00b0\u00b7t_c \u2212\u00bdg\u00b7t_c\u00b2 = (v\u00b7cos60\u00b0\u00b7t_c)\u00b7tan30\u00b0\nThis is a quadratic in t_c; its positive root is proportional to v/g times a dimensionless factor.\n\nStep 6: The distance along the slope s is related to horizontal displacement x_b(t_c) by s = x_b(t_c)/cos30\u00b0. Carrying through the algebra shows that s \u221d v\u00b2. (All trig and g factors remain unchanged when v changes.)\n\nStep 7: Determine ratio. If v is halved (v\u2192v/2), then s_new \u221d (v/2)\u00b2 = v\u00b2/4.

              "question": "An engineer is designing a projectile launcher that fires small rockets toward a target on a hillside. The launcher is located at point O on level ground, and the target T is 100 m horizontally from O and 30 m above O. Air resistance is negligible. To make the rocket pass exactly over the crest of the hill at point C (which lies halfway, 50 m horizontally from O), the engineer chooses an initial speed $v_0$ and launch angle of 45\u00b0 so that the trajectory goes through C with zero vertical velocity at that instant. \n\nIf the engineer decides to keep the same initial speed $v_0$ but increases the launch angle to a value greater than 45\u00b0, which of the following statements about the motion of the rocket as it passes point C remains correct?",
              "solution": "Knowledge Tested:  This question tests two\u2010dimensional kinematics, specifically decomposition of velocity into horizontal and vertical components, use of horizontal motion to find time, and how changing launch angle at constant speed affects those components.\n\nWhat the Question Is Asking:  Starting from a known launch configuration (45\u00b0), we then raise the angle while keeping the initial speed constant. We must determine how (1) the time to reach the midpoint C, (2) the horizontal component of velocity, and (3) the vertical component of velocity at that midpoint change.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1.  Define components.  For a launch speed $v_0$ and angle \u03b8, the initial horizontal and vertical components are\n   \u2022 $v_{x}=v_{0}\\,\\cos\\theta$\n   \u2022 $v_{y0}=v_{0}\\,\\sin\\theta$.\n\n2.  Time to midpoint C.  The horizontal distance to C is 50 m. Under constant horizontal velocity, the time to reach C is\n   $t_{C}=\\dfrac{\\text{distance}}{v_x}=\\dfrac{50}{v_0 \\cos\\theta}.$\n   If \u03b8 increases (above 45\u00b0) while $v_0$ stays the same, $\\cos\\theta$ decreases, so $v_x$ decreases. A smaller denominator means a larger $t_C$.  \u21d2 Time to reach C increases.\n\n3.  Horizontal component at C.  There is no horizontal acceleration (air resistance neglected), so $v_x=v_0\\cos\\theta$ remains constant through flight. If \u03b8 increases, $\\cos\\theta$ decreases, so $v_x$ decreases.  \u21d2 Horizontal component decreases.\n\n4.  Vertical component at C.  At the original 45\u00b0 launch, the engineer picked $v_0$ so that at C the vertical velocity was zero. For \u03b8 > 45\u00b0, the initial vertical component $v_{y0}=v_0\\sin\\theta$ is larger than it was at 45\u00b0. The flight time to C increased, but algebraic analysis shows the increase in $v_{y0}$ dominates the extra drop due to gravity over the longer time (because $v_0^2=g\\cdot50$ at 45\u00b0, so $v_{y0}$ grows faster than $gt_C$).  Thus, the vertical velocity at C becomes positive (the rocket is still moving upward when it passes that point).  \u21d2 Vertical component at C increases.\n\nTherefore, the only choice matching all three changes is C.\n\nWhy the Other Options Are Incorrect:\n\nA.  Incorrect because it claims the vertical component remains the same. In reality, $v_{y0}$ increases with \u03b8, so the vertical velocity at C becomes positive rather than zero.\n\nB.  Incorrect because it states the vertical component decreases. Raising \u03b8 increases $v_{y0}$ enough that the rocket is still ascending at C, so the vertical component actually increases.\n\nD.  Incorrect because it asserts the time to reach C decreases. A larger angle reduces the horizontal component, so it takes longer, not shorter, to cover the same horizontal distance.\n\nKey Takeaway:  At constant launch speed, increasing launch angle decreases horizontal speed, which lengthens time of flight, and it increases initial vertical speed enough that the projectile is still rising at that point.",

              "question": "A professional motocross rider is preparing to jump her bike across a 25 m-wide canyon. She can adjust four factors before takeoff: her initial launch speed $v_0$, the ramp\u2019s incline angle $\\theta$ above horizontal, the ramp\u2019s vertical height $h$ above the landing point (which is at the same elevation as her takeoff), and even the local gravitational acceleration $g$ (if she were on a different planet). She wonders which of these factors will have the greatest impact on the horizontal distance she travels before landing. If she makes the same small fractional change in each factor independently (for example, increasing each by 5%), which one will produce the largest fractional change in her horizontal range?",
              "solution": "This problem tests 2D kinematics of projectile motion and the relative influence of different parameters on horizontal range. We are asked to compare how a small change in each factor affects the horizontal distance, without giving away equations in the question itself.\n\n1. Identify what is being asked: We need to determine which parameter\u2014$v_0$, $\\theta$, $h$, or $g$\u2014most strongly influences the horizontal range $R$ when each is varied by the same percentage.\n\n2. Recall how range depends on these parameters (for launch and landing at same elevation):\n   $$R = \\frac{v_0^2\\sin(2\\theta)}{g}.$$  \n   Note: $h$ does not appear because takeoff and landing elevations are equal, so $h$ has no effect on $R$ in this setup.\n\n3. Examine each factor:\n   \u2022 Initial speed $v_0$: $R$ is proportional to $v_0^2$. A 1% increase in $v_0$ leads to approximately a 2% increase in $R$.  \n   \u2022 Launch angle $\\theta$: $R$ depends on $\\sin(2\\theta)$, which varies at most between 0 and 1. Near an optimum angle (45\u00b0), small changes in $\\theta$ produce only second\u2010order (tiny) changes in $\\sin(2\\theta)$, so a 1% change in $\\theta$ yields much less than 1% change in $R$.  \n   \u2022 Gravitational acceleration $g$: $R$ is inversely proportional to $g$. A 1% increase in $g$ produces a 1% decrease in $R$.  \n   \u2022 Ramp height $h$: As stated, $h$ cancels out when launch and landing elevations match, so changing $h$ does not change $R$ at all.\n\n4. Compare fractional impacts:\n   \u2013 $v_0$: 2% change in $R$ per 1% change in $v_0$.  \n   \u2013 $g$: 1% change in $R$ per 1% change in $g$.  \n   \u2013 $\\theta$: much less than 1% change in $R$ per 1% change in $\\theta$ around 45\u00b0.  \n   \u2013 $h$: 0% change in $R$ per change in $h$.\n\nTherefore, the initial launch speed $v_0$ has the greatest influence on horizontal range.\n\nWhy the other options are incorrect:\nA. Ramp angle $\\theta$ \u2014 Incorrect. Although angle matters, near the optimal angle of 45\u00b0, small variations change $\\sin(2\\theta)$ very little, so the effect on range is minimal.  \nB. Local gravity $g$ \u2014 Incorrect. Gravity does affect range, but it only produces a proportional inverse change (1% in $g$ \u2192 1% in range), which is smaller than the 2% effect from $v_0$.  \nC. Ramp height $h$ \u2014 Incorrect. With takeoff and landing at the same elevation, $h$ cancels from the range equation, so it has no effect on horizontal distance.  \nD. Initial launch speed $v_0$ \u2014 Correct. Range varies as the square of $v_0$, so small percentage changes in speed yield twice that percentage change in distance.\n",

We are asked which component of the initial velocity determines the time of flight for a projectile launched from a height.\n\nStep 1: Restate the problem in simpler terms.  A projectile is launched from a height with some initial horizontal and vertical velocity components.  Its time in the air depends only on its vertical motion under gravity, not on how fast it travels horizontally.\n\nStep 2: Identify the relevant kinematics concept.  The vertical displacement from launch height y\u2080 to ground (y = 0) satisfies a quadratic in time that involves only the vertical component of the initial velocity and gravity (the horizontal component does not appear in this equation).\n\nStep 3: Determine which component must be fixed.  Because the time of flight depends solely on the initial vertical velocity component (and the fixed height), keeping that vertical component constant ensures identical flight times, no matter what horizontal component is used.\n\nWhy the other options are incorrect:\nA: Horizontal component of velocity.  The horizontal component affects only horizontal range, not time of flight, so varying it won\u2019t change the time but keeping it fixed isn\u2019t what controls time.  This is a distractor.\nB: Total initial speed.  Changing the horizontal component while holding total speed constant would necessarily change the vertical component, altering flight time.\nC: Launch angle.  If the launch angle changes (with a fixed total speed), the vertical component changes, altering the flight time.\nD: Vertical component of initial velocity.  Correct.  The time a projectile spends in the air is set by its vertical motion under gravity and the drop height; holding this constant fixes the time of flight.",

              "solution": "This question tests your understanding of two-dimensional kinematics, specifically the decomposition of motion into horizontal and vertical components, and how those components combine to determine flight time and range.\n\n**Step 1: Restate the problem more simply.**\nA projectile is launched from a height h=20 m with fixed launch speed v\u2080=15 m/s at various angles \u03b8. We want to know qualitatively how (1) the total flight time T and (2) the horizontal distance R depend on \u03b8 from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze vertical motion to see how T depends on \u03b8.**\n- Vertically, the initial velocity component is v\u2080y = v\u2080 sin \u03b8.  \n- The probe must travel from height +20 m down to the valley floor (\u221220 m relative to launch), under constant acceleration \u2212g.  \n- Solving the vertical displacement equation shows that as sin \u03b8 increases (\u03b8 increases), the time to rise and then fall back to the lower level **always increases**.  \n- At \u03b8=0\u00b0, there is no upward component, so fall time is smallest (the probe just drops horizontally).  \n- At \u03b8=90\u00b0, all of the speed is vertical, giving the longest possible flight time before returning down.  \n- **Conclusion:** T increases monotonically as \u03b8 goes from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze horizontal motion to see how R depends on \u03b8.**\n- Horizontally, the initial velocity component is v\u2080x = v\u2080 cos \u03b8, and there is no horizontal acceleration.  \n- The range is R = v\u2080x \u22c5 T = (v\u2080 cos \u03b8)\u00b7T(\u03b8).  \n- As \u03b8 increases, cos \u03b8 decreases (reducing v\u2080x), but T increases (from Step 2).  \n- At low \u03b8, cos \u03b8 is large but T is small, so R starts small.  \n- As \u03b8 increases, the increase in T initially outweighs the decrease in cos \u03b8, so R grows.  \n- Beyond some intermediate angle, the drop in cos \u03b8 overtakes the gain in T, so R decreases.  \n- For launch from ground level, the maximum range occurs at 45\u00b0, but launching from a height shifts the exact optimum slightly.  \n- **Conclusion:** R increases from \u03b8=0\u00b0 up to an intermediate angle (somewhere near 45\u00b0) and then decreases to zero at \u03b8=90\u00b0.\n\n**Step 4: Match to answer choices.**\n- T increases monotonically.  \n- R increases then decreases.  \n\nTherefore, **option B** is correct.\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\nA. \u201cT increases; R increases.\u201d  \n- Incorrect because it claims R keeps increasing up to 90\u00b0, but we know R must go to zero at 90\u00b0 (no horizontal component).\n\nC. \u201cT decreases then increases; R increases then decreases.\u201d  \n- Incorrect because T does **not** decrease at low angles; even at \u03b8=0\u00b0 it has a finite drop time, and increasing \u03b8 only makes T longer.\n\nD. \u201cT increases then decreases; R decreases.\u201d  \n- Incorrect on both counts: T never decreases, and R does not decrease monotonically (it must start small, grow to a maximum, then fall).",
