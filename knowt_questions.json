            {"question": "What is a vector in the context of 2D kinematics?", "options": {"A": "A quantity with only magnitude", "B": "A quantity with both magnitude and direction", "C": "An equation of motion", "D": "A scalar quantity"}, "correct_option": "B", "solution": "A vector has both an amount of quantity and direction, which is critical when analyzing motion in more than one dimension."},
            {"question": "Why are the big 3 kinematic equations limited to one dimension?", "options": {"A": "Because they do not account for direction", "B": "Because they only deal with time", "C": "Because they require vectors", "D": "All of the above"}, "correct_option": "A", "solution": "The big 3 kinematic equations only work in one dimension as they do not incorporate direction, which is essential in 2D motion."},
            {"question": "How do you differentiate motion in 2D kinematics?", "options": {"A": "By using different colors", "B": "By splitting into horizontal and vertical components", "C": "By using a single variable for both dimensions", "D": "By ignoring one dimension"}, "correct_option": "B", "solution": "Motion in 2D kinematics is differentiated by splitting the vector into horizontal and vertical components, facilitating analysis in both dimensions."},
            {"question": "What does the subscript 'x' signify in the kinematic equations?", "options": {"A": "It indicates the time variable", "B": "It denotes the horizontal component", "C": "It refers to the vertical dimension", "D": "It signifies acceleration"}, "correct_option": "B", "solution": "In the kinematic equations, the subscript 'x' indicates the horizontal component of motion, distinguishing it from the vertical component, which is denoted by 'y'."},
            {"question": "What relationship does time have in 2D kinematics?", "options": {"A": "It is independent between dimensions", "B": "It is a vector quantity", "C": "It is a scalar and the same in both dimensions", "D": "It only relates to vertical motion"}, "correct_option": "C", "solution": "In 2D kinematics, time is a scalar quantity and remains the same across both the horizontal and vertical dimensions, linking their respective motions."},
            {"question": "Which of the following equations involves both horizontal and vertical components?", "options": {"A": "vx = v{xo} + ax t", "B": "x = xo + v{xo} t + \frac{1}{2} ax t^2", "C": "vy^2 = v{yo}^2 + 2 ay (y - yo)", "D": "All of the above"}, "correct_option": "D", "solution": "All of these equations involve either or both the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components, essential for solving 2D kinematic problems."},
            {"question": "What is a key feature of time in 2D kinematic problem solving?", "options": {"A": "It varies by component", "B": "It only needs to be calculated once", "C": "It can be neglected in calculations", "D": "Time must be separately considered for each dimension"}, "correct_option": "B", "solution": "In 2D problems, while it affects both dimensions, time needs to only be calculated once and shared across both horizontal and vertical components."},
            {"question": "When analyzing a vector in terms of components, what trigonometric functions are typically used?", "options": {"A": "Sine and Cosine", "B": "Tangent and Secant", "C": "Cotangent and Cosecant", "D": "Identity functions"}, "correct_option": "A", "solution": "Sine and cosine functions are used to resolve a vector into its horizontal and vertical components based on its direction and magnitude."},
            {"question": "What does the equation (vy = v{yo} + ay t) represent in geometric terms?", "options": {"A": "The total distance traveled", "B": "The final vertical velocity after a time t", "C": "The acceleration due to gravity only", "D": "The initial vertical position"}, "correct_option": "B", "solution": "This equation represents the final vertical velocity of an object after time t, incorporating its initial velocity and vertical acceleration."},
            {"question": "In projectile motion, why is it critical to analyze vertical and horizontal motions separately?", "options": {"A": "They happen at different times", "B": "They are influenced by different forces", "C": "They are independent of each other", "D": "Both B and C"}, "correct_option": "D", "solution": "Vertical and horizontal motions are independent of each other and influenced by different forces, making it essential to analyze them separately in projectile motion."}
