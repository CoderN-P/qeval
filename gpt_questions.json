        },
        "correct_option": "B",
        "solution": "At the highest point, the vertical velocity becomes zero. Use the equation v_y = v_{yo} + a_y * t. Since a_y is -9.8 m/s² and v_y = 0, the time can be calculated as t = (0 - v_{yo}) / a_y. The initial vertical velocity is v_{yo} = v_0 * sin(30) = 20 * 0.5 = 10 m/s. Therefore, t = 10 / 9.8 ≈ 1.0 s."

        "solution": "First, calculate the time to fall using y = y_o + v_{yo} * t + (1/2) * a_y * t². Since v_{yo} = 0 and y_o = 20 m, the time is t = √(2 * y_o / 9.8) = √(2 * 20 / 9.8) ≈ 2.02 s. Now calculate the horizontal distance: x = v_x * t = 15 * 2.02 ≈ 30.3 m."
